Over a quarter of a century ago, two warriors faced one another across the field of battle….. Each one silently and stoicly aware of the apprehension all soldiers feel prior to battle. The battle raged for over a year and a half and BOTH were victorious…... How could this be possible?

One warrior was a prosecutor for the county, the other a defender of the accused. During the battle, each warrior began to recognize and respect the skills of the other. During the course of the multiple cases they opposed each other, they formed the basis of an enduring friendship.

And now, 27 years later, that enduring friendship has become the foundation of a law firm dedicated to achieving justice for each and every accused individual. Together, their combined 70 years of criminal defense and prosecutorial experience have blended to produce a unique, dynamic and stress relieving experience for their clients.

Criminal statutes are sophisticated, and new legislation keeps the law evolving. Therefore, if you are charged with a crime, you should consider an attorney that understands the local courtroom and proceedings to defend you in court. It is the reason we invite you to reach out to us at the Orange County Criminal Defense Team at 714-467-2772 if you are faced with allegations or charges for a crime.
